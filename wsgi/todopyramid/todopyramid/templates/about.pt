    <h1>About ToDo Pyramid</h1>

    <p>ToDo Pyramid is a test app that was created by Six Feet Up in a few days
    for the <a href="https://github.com/indypy/web-shootout" target="_blank">IndyPy Web Shootout</a>. We believe that Pyramid is better than
    Django, Flask, and Bottle due to its flexibility and speed.</p>

    <h1>About Pyramid</h1>

    <p><a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about" target="_blank">Pyramid</a> is a Python based open source web framework. According to the
    project's website:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>As a framework, its primary job is to make it easier for a developer
    to create an arbitrary web application. The type of application being
    created isnâ€™t really important; it could be a spreadsheet, a corporate
    intranet, or a social networking platform. Pyramid is general enough
    that it can be used in a wide variety of circumstances.</p>
